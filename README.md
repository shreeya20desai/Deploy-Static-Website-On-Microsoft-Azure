# Deploy-Static-Website-On-Microsoft-Azure

## Overview

This project implements a visitor count for a static website using the Azure Function (serverless API) and Azure CosmosDB. Each visit to the website triggers the Azure Function, which increments the visitor count in Cosmos DB.

## Key features:

- Serverless architecture using Azure Functions (Python runtime),
- Persistent visitor count stored in Cosmos DB.
- Static website hosted on Azure Storage ($web container).
- Secure API access using function-level keys.

## Technology Used

- Azure Functions
- Azure CosmosDB

# Note:

- The website used in this project was designed during my personal freecodecamp certification.
